# sesstop
This script report top N sql-sessions in db with statname.
It's cli-utility, bash script, which works like top-utility, but with data about oracle sql-session;
```
sesstop [options]
Options:
 -l	--list	[class]		show list of statistics in class
 -f	--find  [name]		find statistic with name
 -i	--id	<stat id>	  run top on stat id number with default parameters (10 elements and 20 seconds delay)
 -d --delay [number]  delay information update delay [default 20 sec]
 -t --top-size			  display number of top elements [default 10]
 -h     --help        display this help and exit
 ```

As a prerequirements: sqlite should be installed and be available.
Current version of the script was developed with sqlite 3.3.6;
You have to write full path to sqlite-binary and database-file to bash-variables __SQLITE, SQLITE_DB__ inside the script;
Or you can provide the script with that information (and make some other settings) through conf-file, which have to be placed at the same directory and named as __sesstop.conf__
For instance:
```bash
CONF_FILE="sesstop.conf"
cat << __EOF__ > "$CONF_FILE"
TMP_DIR="/tmp/sesstat_$$"
TMP_FILE="/tmp/sesstat_$$/temp.dat"
SQLITE="/usr/bin/sqlite3"
SQLITE_DB="/tmp/sesstat_$$/sesstop_$$.dbf"
DELAY="5"
TOP_SIZE="15"
__EOF__
./sesstop.sh -i 12
```

Script's concept and sql-queries was offered by Maksim Ivanov ([MaksimIvanovPerm](https://github.com/MaksimIvanovPerm) )

Some code and parameters options processing was developed by Denis Vodopyanov ([dvodop](https://github.com/dvodop) )
